# Labirynt
Maze game in Java using Swing API.

# Welcome to the maze game!
You are a fiery red ball whose task is to reach the treasure with the least number of moves by navigating the arrow buttons. In your arsenal, you have bombs that you can use to blow up the maze walls blocking you and destroy nearby enemies using the spacebar. Remember, however, that each ball movement reduces your points by 1, and using the bomb by 4. 

Have fun and good luck!
